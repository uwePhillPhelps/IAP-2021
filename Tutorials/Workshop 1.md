Welcome to IAP (Introductory audio programming)

This workshop will introduce the tools used on the module in a creative and playful way. The idea is to familiarise you with the lab machines, and how we will use the hardware and software on the Introductory Audio Programming module. By the end of this session you should be familiar with: 

1.	The Apple workstations in the faculty labs. 
2.	The Xcode development environment.
3.	The Aserve application and some of its features. 

## About IAP

Programmed electronic devices are abundant in every sector of the music industry. In whichever area you choose to focus your studies - in the creation or use of audio technology - an intimate understanding of the inner workings of these devices will naturally enhance your abilities.

Throughout this module you will learn important fundamental programming skills and concepts by writing programs that perform audio and music related tasks. 

## Weekly tasks

All IAP learning materials are provided upfront - organised so that you can work at your own pace - but we will examine topics in classes on a week by week schedule. Each tutorial introduces a new programming concept which will be explored and exercised in the C++ programming language. 

Your **first task** is to download the IAP repository (which contains all of the required materials and applications)

::‚û°Ô∏è:: [Download master branch zip file](../../../archive/refs/heads/master.zip) ::‚¨ÖÔ∏è::

Staff can help you set up your own machine for working off-campus. For now, let's use the lab machines. **University lab machines already have Xcode installed and are ready for roll for playful exploration of introductory programming for audio** üòäüëç 

## Opening the IAP Project

Once you have downloaded the materials, the next step is to open the code project:

1. You're looking for the iapProj-M folder (the IAP project for Apple M-series CPUs)
2. Expand the folder structure until you can see the Builds > MacOSX > iapProj.xcodeproj file
3. Double click this to open the Xcode editor application automatically load in our project

You may need to accept and close various warnings and welcoming information screens and messages shown below.

After the Xcode editor application has loaded

1. Expand the project hierarchy until you can see the file `IAP.cpp`
4. **Single click** on `IAP.cpp` to open it for viewing

If you double-click by mistake, close the separate window that will appear, and try again. Ensure your Xcode window looks the same as the screenshot below.
