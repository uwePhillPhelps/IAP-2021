# Workshop 1 â€“ Playful and creative exploration

This workshop will introduce the tools used on the module in a creative and playful way. The idea is to familiarise you with the lab machines, and how we will use the hardware and software on the Introductory Audio Programming module. By the end of this session you should be familiar with: 

1.	The Apple workstations in the faculty labs. 
2.	The Xcode development environment.
3.	The Aserve application and some of its features.
