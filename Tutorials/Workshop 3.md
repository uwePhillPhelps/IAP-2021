# Workshop 3 â€“ Audio processing

This workshop will introduce audio effect processing. The idea is to record your own audio and/or use the supplied recordings for creative and playful exploration. By the end of this session you should be familiar with: 

1.	Recording audio and audio effect plugins
2.	Basic digital signal processing concepts
3.	Building and installing audio plugin .components

The workshop text assumes you understand what Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) is and how audio effect plugins can be inserted onto audio tracks/channels within a DAW. Step by step instructions are provided, so even if you're not totally familiar with these concepts yet, you can still have fun in this workshop. ðŸ˜Š

## Getting started

We provide several files as a starting point. These files are compatible with the MacOS software on lab machines. All files are zipped for convenient distribution.

1. Download `IAPAudioPlug.zip` from designated download location 
2. Download `Logic_DAW_Project.zip` from designated download location
   a. Put this file aside for later. We will need it soon, but not initially

## Pieces of the puzzle

You'll use Xcode to build the `IAPAudioPlug` xcode project into an audio plugin `.component`...
...then use the Logic DAW to record some of your own audio and...
...process the sound with audio plugin code that **you design**...

## A word of warning

If you accidentally open the supplied Logic DAW project before the plugin is ready, an error message will warn you of a required, missing component.

The supplied xcode project and code will build this missing component, allowing you to experiment with simple audio effect processing such as:
* Gain
* Panning
* Distortion
* Delay
* Tremolo
* ...and more (if you desire!)!

## Exercise 1 - Build

1. Unzip the `IAPAudioPlug.zip`, navigate to the folder `builds > MacOSX` and load the `IAPAudioPlug.xcodeproj` with xcode.
2. Use the menu to select `Product > Scheme > IAPAudioPlug-ALL`
   a. For the curious: different schemes configure different types of plugin technology.
   b. The icons for various schemes are different. The desired scheme has a dart-board target icon similar to this ðŸŽ¯
   
3. Build the project â€“ await success 
4. Examine the files within the `IAPAudioPlug > builds > MacOSX` folder
   a. there should now be a `build -> Debug` folder containing a variety of files
   b. focus your attention on the `IAPAudioPlug.component` - confirm the date modified matches todays date and time

## Exercise 2 - Install

On MacOS there are several places one may install an audio plugin component. The most convenient is within your personal 'home' Library folder.
We need to drag the `IAPAudioPlug.component` into this 'home' library folder, so we'll need a secondary Finder window.

1. Select the Finder and use the menu `Finder > New Finder Window`
2. Then use the menu `Go > Go to Folder...`
3. Search for `~/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/Components`
   a. Be **absolutely sure to use the ~ symbol in the search path here**
   b. Finder will not permit you to access the 'root' Library folder
   c. The ~ symbol indicates you wish to access your personal 'home' Library folder
   d. Ask a member of staff if you need assistance

4. Drag the `IAPAudioPlug.component` into your personal 'home' Library of audio plugin components.

## Exercise 3 - Creative exploration!

1. Open the downloaded Logic DAW project
2. Voila! Plugin do the things. Happy fun time exploration yay! ðŸ˜Š

If everything has gone well, you will see the IAPaudioplug controls, similar to the screenshot below.

Creative prompts
* Go and change the code, rebuild, delete the old component and add in the new component, and relaunch the Logic Project 
* Gain to Stereo panner -> uncomment the code, should be stereo panner BUT ITS NOT. Already adjusted gain prior, comment out the old code also.  
* Distortion -> distortion works but too weak; how to make it stronger? 
* Delay -> non-Feedback vs Feedback â€“ differences? Change delay time? 
* Tone gen modify`+=` symbols to `*=` for tone vs ring modulation
* Tone gen modify oscillator frequency for tremolo
