# Getting Started

Welcome to IAP (Introductory audio programming)

## About IAP

Programmed electronic devices are abundant in every sector of the music industry. In whichever area you choose to focus your studies - in the creation or use of audio technology - an intimate understanding of the inner workings of these devices will naturally enhance your abilities. 

Throughout this module you will learn important fundamental programming skills and concepts by writing programs that perform audio and music related tasks. 

## Weekly tasks

All IAP learning materials are provided upfront - organised so that you can work at your own pace - but we will examine topics in classes on a week by week schedule. Each tutorial introduces a new programming concept which will be explored and exercised in the C++ programming language. 

Whilst you are free to move ahead at your own pace if you wish, **It is very important to attend support sessions. The secret here to passing this module (and achieving a state of music tech bliss) is to ask questions and engage with the weekly support sessions!**

## The IAP repository

Download the IAP repository (which contains all of the required materials and applications)

:: ‚û°Ô∏è :: [Download master branch zip file](../../../archive/refs/heads/master.zip) :: ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ::

## Opening the IAP Project

Once you have downloaded the materials, the next step is to open the code project for your platform. The image below shows the folder structure. See the video guides linked at the bottom of this page for more help.

Once your editor application has started:

1. Use the panel on the left to select the `iapProj` > `Source` > `IAP.cpp` file for editing.
2. **Single click** on `IAP.cpp` to open it for editing. 

If you double-click by mistake, close the separate window that will appear, and try again. Ensure your Xcode window looks the same as the screenshot below.

## A clean starting point

Remember that the iapProj can be changed and edited, each week we will explore a new topic, and **it is best to begin each week's tutorial with a "clean slate"**. For this reason we have prepared starting point template files.

You can reset the code in your iapProj to a "clean" state with the <a href="../Code%20Exercises/Tutorial%201/">files provided here</a>.
 
### TASK: edit your iapProj files

Edit **both** `IAP.cpp` and `IAP.h` in your Xcode editor. You may either:

1. Copy-paste from github into the Xcode editor, replacing the existing code with the <a href="../Code%20Exercises/Tutorial%201/">clean files provided</a>
2. Download from github and move the files on disk, replacing the existing code

Please ask staff if you need assistance with either of these steps. We're happy to help!
