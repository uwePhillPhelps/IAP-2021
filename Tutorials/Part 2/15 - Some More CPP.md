# Tutorial 16 â€“ Some more C++

In this practical we will learn about a few additional topics that you might find useful for the assignment, as well as learning more about C++.

1.	2D arrays
2.	Auto
3.	Range based for loops
4.	Ternary operator
5.  	Version control

## 2D arrays

We have looked at using single dimension arrays, however there are a number of occasions where we might want to have arrays with more than one dimension. For example, we can create a 10 x 10 array by applying the following:

```cpp
std::array< std::array<int, 10>, 10> tenByTen;
```

To access each dimension, you use another set of [] brackets.

```cpp
tenByTen[0][0] = 10;
```

The general form of a 2D array looks like:

```cpp
std::array< std::array<int, /* inner size*/>, /*outer size*/> tenByTen;

tenByTen[/*outer index*/][/*inner index*/]
```

## 2D vectors

You can also have 2D vectors, however they are a little more challenging to conceptualise as each row can have a different size.

```cpp
std::vector< std::vector<int> > _2dVector;
```

And just to make things more complicated you can also have a vector of array, or any combination of such data structures:

```cpp
std::vector<std::array<int, 10> > vectorOf10ElementArrays;
```

## Exercise 1: 

We will be remaking our scale function.

We will be using a 2D std::array with an inner size of 12 and an outer size of 8. This array will hold scale information and allow us to quickly quantize note numbers into a scale. The outer index will specify the scale number, and the inner number will specify each scale degree. We can set the values for a single scale by using the following line of code:

```cpp
  scales[0] = {0,1,0,1, 0,0,1,0, 1,0,1,0};
```
	
Note that we must supply as many arguments between the {} as there are elements in the array, as there are 12 elements for the inner size we must supply 12. Note that the above code is a shortened version of doing:

```cpp
  scales[0][0] = 0;
  scales[0][1] = 1;
  scales[0][2] = 0;
  ...
```

To get started:
1. Reload a previous synthesiser program to use for this exercise.
2. Create a shared std::array called scales as specified above.
3. Create a shared variable called chosenScale.
4. At the start of your run function setup the scale values.
5. You can use the following code snippet to quantise notes to a scale.

```cpp

int pitch = note % 12;
return note + scales[chosenScale][pitch];

```

## Auto

In C++ we have to define the type when declaring a variable. However, in other programming languages **type** is inferred by the complier. There are occasions in C++ when we can use the auto variable data type to allow the compiler to determine the data type for us.

```cpp
   auto a = "hello";
   auto b = 10;
   auto c = 0.5;
   
   std::cout << a << ", " << b << ", " << c << "\n";
```

When we run a program contain the above code and then open the debugger we can see that these variables have data types determined by the compiler.

If you can determine the data type yourself then you should declare it as such, however there are a number of useful occasions where we might use the auto type. We will return to this at the end of this tutorial.


## Range based for loops

We have been making frequent use of the following code snippet to iterate over the contents of arrays and vectors:

```cpp
    std::vector<int> values = {0, 1, 3, 5};
    
    for (int i = 0; i < values.size(); i++) {
        std::cout << values[i] << "\n";
    }
```

However, there is variant of the for loop that we can use instead:

```cpp
    for (int i : values) {
        std::cout << i << ", ";
    }
```

We are creating a temporary variable as we did before, followed by the single colon **:** operator, and then we supply the array we wish to iterate over.  

Range based for loops will iterate over each value from the starting position 0 up to the last element. Note that the value **i** will hold a copy of the value at each index. So therefore, this loop is only able to read each element. We can adapt this code by using the & operator, to take a reference to each element in the array, therefore we can both read and write data. However, you should only use the & operator if you really need to modify each element!

```cpp
    //Double each element
    for (int & i : values) {
        i *= 2;
    }
```

Note then when using range-based loops, it is very common to the replace the data type with an auto type.

```cpp
    //Double each element
    for (auto & i : values) {
        i *= 2;
    }
```

## Exercise 2: Range based for loops
Refactor a previous program that you have written to use a range based for loop. Practical 10 exercise 3 or practical 11 exercise 3 are good starting points, however you may choose a different one.

## Ternary Operator

We have previously seen and used the following code (waveType is a shared variable) 

```cpp
void IAP::callbackModWheelMoved (int value)
{
    //Switch between sine and saw
    if (value < 64) {
        waveType = 0;
    }
    else {
        waveType = 1;
    }
}
```

Instead of using an if-else statement we can use the **Ternary** operator:

```cpp
void IAP::callbackModWheelMoved (int value)
{
    //Switch between sine and saw
    waveType = value < 64 ? 0 : 1;
}
```

The general form of a Ternary operator is as follows:

```cpp
   (condition) ? true value : false value;
```

The condition is first checked, then if the condition is true the value following the ? operator is returned, otherwise the value following the : operator is returned instead. Ternary statements can be used to significantly reduce the size of code. In this example we have replace 6 lines of code with 1.

The ternary operator can also be used to call functions:

```cpp
    if (filterType == 1) {
        aserveHPF(cutoff);
    }
    else {
        aserveLPF(cutoff);
    }
```
or:

```cpp
   (filterType == 1) ? aserveHPF(cutoff) : aserveLPF(cutoff);
```

## Exercise 3:

Use the ternary operator to refactor a previous program that you have written.
