# Workshop 2 â€“ Playful and creative extension

This workshop will extend the materials provided in workshop 1 earlier. The idea is to XYZ . By the end of this session you should be familiar with: 

1.	FOO.
2.	BAR.
3.	BAZ. 

## Getting started

The following assumes you have set your `IAP.cpp` and `IAP.h` files to the <a href="../iapProjM/Source/IAP.cpp">starting point CPP</a> and the <a href="../iapProjM/Source/IAP.h"> starting point H file</a> provided. Copy and replace your current files with these to get started ðŸ˜Š

## Drums please!

Your first task is probably to scroll down to the drum sequence section which looks like this

```cpp
  thing
  stuff
  blah
```

...and to **add an extra beat** to turn our 4/4 rhythm into a 5/4 rhythm.

## Broken beat 

Let's adjust the rhythm to make the timing between beats uneven. Adjust the `aserveSleep()` values so that some are shorter, and some are longer... perhaps

```cpp
   sample
   sleep( 100 )
   sample
   sleep( 110 )
   sample
   sleep( 90 )
```
