# Working on your own machine

Development environments such as Visual Studio and Xcode are fairly heavy in terms of storage requirements but you can download appropriate software for your own machine. 

**We strongly recommend working with the lab machines, as these are ready to roll and require barely more than logging in to get started** üòäüëç

### MacOS machines

Besides downloading the IAP repository (which contains all of the required materials and applications for the module)

::arrow_right:: [Download master branch zip file](../../../archive/refs/heads/master.zip) ::arrow_left::

Use the App Store to download XCode.

Apple usually distribute only the latest XCode for the latest MacOS which **can** mean compatibility problems with other applications if you upgrade. Think carefully before you upgrade a working system, remember that the university machines already have Xcode installed. 

Apple maintain an archive of XCode versions for various MacOS versions here:

https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

Please join the Apple developer network (at no cost) here:

A video guide for setting up XCode on MacOS is here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQFYdAl54XE">MacOS setup</a>

If you have an older mac, this video might be more helpful:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQFYdAl54XE">Older MacOS setup video</a> and the list of compatible versions of XCode maintained here:

### Windows machines

Download the windows branch of this IAP repository (which contains all of the required materials and applications)

::arrow_right:: [Download windows branch zip file](../../../archive/refs/heads/windows.zip) ::arrow_left::

You will need to download Microsoft's Visual Studio.
We recommend and support Visual Studio 2019 as it is extremely stable, but it is possible to use newer and older versions.

A video guide for setting up Visual Studio on Windows is here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTzXlonKeo">Windows setup video</a> The setup video describes Visual studio 2017 but everything shown is compatible with Visual Studio 2019 and newer.
